In Next.js 15, a subtle bug can occur when using the `app` directory with dynamic routes and client-side data fetching.  If a component's data fetching logic relies on a route parameter that is not yet available during the initial render (e.g., fetching data based on `params.id` within `page.js`), the component might render with outdated or missing data, leading to unexpected behavior. This is particularly relevant when using `use`, `getServerSideProps`, or `getStaticProps` with dynamic routes. The issue stems from the timing of data fetching and component rendering during the hydration process. The solution involves carefully coordinating data fetching to ensure the necessary data is available before the component is rendered on the client-side, often through the use of suspense and loading states.
